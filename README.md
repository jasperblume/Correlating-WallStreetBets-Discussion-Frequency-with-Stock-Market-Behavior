# WallStreetBets Market Correlation Analysis

Statistical analysis examining the relationship between r/WallStreetBets discussion patterns and stock market behavior across 6 major securities (NVDA, TSLA, SPY, PLTR, SMCI, RDDT).

## Key Findings

- **Strong correlation** between WSB mentions and trading volume (r=0.14-0.71, all p<0.001)
- **Moderate correlation** between mentions and price volatility (r=0.21-0.46, all p<0.001)  
- **Minimal predictive value** from sentiment analysis (râ‰¤0.12)
- **WSB primarily reacts to** rather than predicts market movements

_This analysis demonstrates that while WSB discussion volume reliably indicates market attention and volatility, sentiment provides negligible predictive value for price direction._
